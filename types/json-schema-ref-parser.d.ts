    /**
     * Dereferences all `$ref` pointers in the JSON Schema, replacing each reference with its resolved value. This results in a schema object that does not contain any `$ref` pointers. Instead, it's a normal JavaScript object tree that can easily be crawled and used just like any other JavaScript object. This is great for programmatic usage, especially when using tools that don't understand JSON references.
     *
     * The dereference method maintains object reference equality, meaning that all `$ref` pointers that point to the same object will be replaced with references to the same object. Again, this is great for programmatic usage, but it does introduce the risk of circular references, so be careful if you intend to serialize the schema using `JSON.stringify()`. Consider using the bundle method instead, which does not create circular references.

The resulting schema size will be small, since it will still contain internal JSON references rather than being fully-dereferenced.

     * Unlike the `canRead` function, the `read` method can also be asynchronous. This might be important if your resolver needs to read data from a database or some other external source.
