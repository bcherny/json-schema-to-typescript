- Be sure to add a test for each change you make

## Tips

- Use `npm run tdd` to compile and re-run tests when a file is modified
- Use `DEBUG=true npm run tdd` to add logging output to the above command
- Add `export let only=true` to a test in test/e2e to just run that test
- Add `export let exclude=true` to a test in test/e2e to not run that test
